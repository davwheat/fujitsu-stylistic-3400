# Fujitsu Stylistic 3400 Drivers

As of the time of writing, the official Fujitsu drivers page is still live.

For historical purposes, I've downloaded a copy of all the drivers on the website to preserve.

## Windows 2000

**These drivers will also work in XP, but are not digitally signed.**

Pen drivers v1.4 seem to have an issue in XP which causes error dialogs after log-in. You can fix this by running `msconfig` from the Run dialog, then going to the `Startup` tab, and unchecking `penmon`.

BatteryAid seems to provide no useful settings on XP, so it's up to you if you want to install it.
