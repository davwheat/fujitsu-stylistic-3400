   PCI shared interrupts


Shared interrupts are normal in PCI servers, but not all
PCI device drivers support them. Although this adapter
supports shared interrupts, other PCI drivers used by your 
server may not.

If you're having problems with a shared interrupt, try one
of the following:

1  Use your server's BIOS setup program to change the
   interrupt assigned to this adapter.

2  Make sure that the adapter device driver loads
   AFTER the driver for any other device sharing this
   interrupt.

3  Contact the manufacturer of the other adapter or add-in
   card that is sharing this interrupt for a new driver.
