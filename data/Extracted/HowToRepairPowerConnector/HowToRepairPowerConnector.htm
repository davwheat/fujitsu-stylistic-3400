<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 700; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Repairing
the power connector on the ST3500/ST3400</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">You will need a good
quality, #1 philips (+) screw driver.&nbsp;The screws have loctite on them and you will
need to apply some torque to get them in and out. You will also need a good soldering
iron.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Start by powering the unit
off using the &quot;emergency&quot; power button located in the little hole next to the
power switch.&nbsp; Then remove the HDD and battery.&nbsp; You don't need to take off the
memory cover.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Turn the 3400/3500 face
down and remove all the black-headed screws from the bottom.&nbsp; Put them in a small
dish to keep from losing them.&nbsp; The one, long screw goes into the hole marked with an
arrow on the rear cover.</span></p>

width="100" height="72"></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Next separate the top
bezel and the bottom cover.&nbsp; Turn the unit face-up and pry the two pieces apart with
your finger nails.&nbsp; They will come apart.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Set the bezel aside and
remove the digitizer.&nbsp; You will need to take out 6 screws, then disconnect the ribbon
cable at the top of the screen.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a

xthumbnail-orig-image="3500_bezel_removed.jpg" width="100" height="72"></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Remove the screws holding the LCD to the main chassis.&nbsp; Also
remove the screw at the small PCB at the top of the screen and take the microphone out of
its hole. <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">&nbsp;You'll have to remove the
ribbon cable from the DC-DC converter that powers the display backlight also.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a
href="http://mark.rehorst.com/Fujitsu_ST3500/3500_digitizer_removed.jpg"><img
src="3500_digitizer_removed_small.jpg" border="2"
xthumbnail-orig-image="3500_digitizer_removed.jpg" width="100" height="77"></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Now you can remove the LCD
and fold it open. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a
href="http://mark.rehorst.com/Fujitsu_ST3500/3500_LCD_unfolded.jpg"><img
src="3500_LCD_unfolded_small.jpg" border="2" xthumbnail-orig-image="3500_LCD_unfolded.jpg"
width="100" height="64"></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Now you can get to the
power connector.&nbsp; Push it in and then lift it out from the case.&nbsp; It is
connected to the main PCB by a socketed cable.&nbsp; If you pull on it gently the
connector on the main PCB will let go and you will be able to take out the tiny PCB that
the connector is soldered to.&nbsp; Unsolder the connector by heating all three terminals
simultaneously and pulling it away from the PCB.&nbsp; Pry the center contact out of the
connector body with a screw driver.&nbsp; Squeeze the tines of the forked contact together
using some long nose pliers.&nbsp; Slide the contact back into the connector and solder it
back to the little PCB.&nbsp; Now reconnect the the cable to the main PCB by using a small
screw driver to push it into its socket.&nbsp; Reinsert the connector and reverse the
take-apart procedure. </span></p>

width="100" height="85"></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">When you reassemble the
unit, be sure to blow any dust off the digitizer and LCD screens before you screw them
back together.</span></p>
