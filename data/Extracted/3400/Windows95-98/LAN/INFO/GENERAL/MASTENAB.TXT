Normally, your computer should have enabled the adapter for
busmaster operation during power-up.  This server didn't.

The adapter Setup program and all PRO/100+ adapter
drivers take care of this problem for you in most cases.

However, if you have problems with your adapter failing
diagnostic tests, move the adapter to another slot in your
server and try the test again.

If you still have problems, contact your network services
supplier.
