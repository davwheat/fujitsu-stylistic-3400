Being able to take your desktop 'on the road' had long been a dream for business people and for IT designers alike. For the businessman they were no longer tied to their desks and, for the IT designer, it was another hurdle crossed. Naturally the early 'portable' machines had been anything but, but as time had progressed and the technology had improved, the age of the laptop had truly dawned and the wires tying computing to a desk were cut. The laptop computer was a great liberator but wasn't the answer to everything and it still depended on their being something to put the machine on. In environments where this wasn't possible then there needed to be something else.</p><p>
</p><p>The concept of 'pen computing' was one that had been around for decades but the technology required didn't really become feasible until the late-1980s/early-1990s. Palm based devices had shown that a pen based interface was possible and, naturally enough, this soon migrated itself into machines running more 'mainstream software' (i.e. Windows). Fujitsu had made a considerable name for itself with the release of its Stylistic series of machines in 1996 and these managed to put a fully functioning Wintel machine into user's hands. Based around a 80486 CPU, the Stylistic had everything that a laptop or desktop had...but with the advantage of using a pen-based interface.</p>
<p>By 2000 the Stylistic series had evolved to take advantage of newer (and faster) CPUs, more memory etc. but the previous machines that had sported the Stylistic name all followed a similar pattern - the new 3400 was a totally new product.</p>
<p>Based around Intel's Pentium 3 and Celeron CPUs, the machine ran at a blistering 400MHz, came equipped with 64Mb RAM (expandable to 192Mb), onboard sound, USB and a bigger (10.4") screen (running at either 800x600 or 1024x768). In terms of 'package' the new machine was slimmer, lighter and even easier to hold and use and looked to be better in every way (even if many considered the new machine to be less rugged than some of its predecessors). There were 'niggles' though and while the machine sported a PCMCIA slot, the older machines had featured <i>two</i> - hardly a major problem though. In fact in terms of connectivity, the 3400 generally took what had gone before...and added to it.</p>
<p>As impressive as the 3400 was, all of that technology came at a price with the machine ranging from $3500 to over $4100 (with an added $100 if Windows NT4 or 2000 was installed) - hardly the domain of the home user but this wasn't a machine that was aimed the home user. For users that needed the pen based interface, the 3400 was simply first class.</p>

            <p><img src="./The MacMania Museum_ Retro Heaven_ Fujitsu - Stylistic 3400_files/my_stylistic3400.jpg" align="left" border="0">
Long before the arrival of Apple's iPad, I found myself drawn to the concept of tablet computing and although I'd seen Windows based machines as part of my work, the cost meant that it was never going to be an option...until a Stylistic 3400 appeared on eBay. Sold as working complete with it's PSU and stylus, there was only one minor flaw: no hard drive. Now installing a hard drive isn't exactly rocket science (well it isn't for me anyway - my other half may disagree) but what should have been simple turned into another marathon.</p><p>
</p><p>While the actual disk itself needed to be nothing more than a standard 2.5" IDE drive, getting it setup properly proved to be a nightmare as, for some bizarre reason, the 3400 uses a somewhat 'bespoke' disk geometry so formatting it in another machine and then installing it wouldn't work. However with no OS installed, it couldn't be formatted on the 3400 itself. Network? Not an option (as my machine didn't come with an ethernet socket and the chances of it network booting were slim to zero). USB? Well there was a USB socket but the option to boot from USB wasn't there so no go there. User another 3400? Are you mad? It was a pain just to get <i>one</i> of these things. The answer came via the floppy disk socket and, by chance, I managed to source an external drive for less than a king's ransom (oh and of course it was 'non-standard'). Having booted from DOS, the HD was formatted and then came the delightful task of installing Windows...not easy when there's no optical drive and DOS doesn't support USB drives. The answer was far simpler though and with the HD formatted it could be put into an external enclosure, connected up to another machine, the Win98 install files copied onto it and then, when back in the 3400, installed from the HD.</p>
<p>After that marathon (which ended up taking about two weeks what with having to source the floppy drive) the machine itself ran very nicely. OK Windows 98 is never a really great choice but on older hardware (especially, in my case, the 400MHz Celeron version) going for something more 'modern' (e.g. Windows 2000 or XP) ran the risk of running out memory and ending up with a machine that crawled along. Nope, we'll stick with Windows 98.</p>
<p>With the memory maxed out at 192Mb, the only other real 'problem area' was that of networking and, as my machine hadn't come with an ethernet socket, it was up to the PCMCIA slot to help out. The whole point of the tablet was to be 'mobile' so a wi-fi card was added and mobile we were. All running nicely and while not exactly the fastest machine in the world, it's 'workable'.</p>
<p>As an introduction to pen computing, the 3400 was a nice machine. Certainly not a speed demon but not bad. The issue with pen computing though is, as the name suggests, the pen interface. Typing is, naturally, impossible as there's no keyboard so an onscreen one had to be sourced (I'm sure that the original machine must have come with one but no drivers meant having to re-invent the wheel). <i>This</i> took an awful lot of getting used to and was nowhere near as quick as the more 'traditional' input methods. It worked though and here was a 'workable' tablet.</p>
<p>It might be considered 'obsolete' but the 3400 is still a very attractive machine. It feels solid and well built, the interface is responsive and although it's a Wintel machine at heart, it's a decent one. This only leaves us with the question of whether I'd recommend one. Well it's a nice machine and it runs well <i>but</i> it's definitely 'old tech' and that, naturally, means that it comes with 'issues'. In the 'modern world' it's vulnerable to viruses and the like (try getting a decent virus scanner that still supports Windows 98 and doesn't eat all of the CPU), the difficulties in setting one up from scratch can be 'trying' and there are a wealth of more up to date, faster machines out there. That said though, it does have a certain charm about it: it's 'quirky' (but in a good way), it's easy to use and if you can be realistic about what it's capable of then you might just get away with it - I know I like mine an awful lot more than several 'better' tablets.</p>
