LOCATION OF SETUP FILE:   \NET82557.INF


DETERMINING YOUR VERSION OF WINDOWS 95
======================================

    Follow the steps below to determine which version of Windows 95 you 
    are running:

    1.  Click on the Start button.
    2.  Select Settings.
    3.  Select the Control Panel.
    4.  Double-click on the System icon. The System Properties dialog 
        box opens.
    5.  Select the General tab. Information about your system is
        displayed, including the version of Windows 95 you are
        running, under System.

General Instructions (For version 950B Only)
============================================

1  Install the adapter in the computer and turn on the power.  Have the
   Windows 95 CD ROM available, as you will need it to copy additional
   files. While Windows 95 is starting, it will detect the new hardware.

2  When Windows 95 starts, a New Hardware Found dialog box appears. It
   identifies the adapter as a PCI Ethernet Controller.  Insert the
   Configuration and Drivers disk or CD in the appropriate drive,
   and at the Update Device Driver Wizard, click Next.

   NOTE: If the New Hardware Found dialog box doesn't appear, you'll
         need to manually configure the adapter. See the section
         "Alternatives for Adding Network Cards to Windows 95".

3  The Update Device Driver Wizard lists the driver it has found as
   the Intel(R) PRO/100+ PCI Adapter.  Click Finish.

4  A dialog may appear requesting Windows 95 system network files. If
   so, follow the instructions.
      
      Note: The Windows 95 system files are typically available on the
            Windows 95 CD in the win95 directory (D:\win95). If Windows
            95 requests the E100B.DOS file or the 8255XNDI.DL_ files,
            they can be found on the Configuration and Drivers disk.

6  The Systems Setting Change dialog appears indicating you should
   restart the system for changes to become effective.  Remove the
   Configuration and Drivers disk from the drive and click Yes for the 
   changes to take effect.


Advanced Configuration Parameters
---------------------------------

An advanced configuration utility called PROSet was installed on your
system when you installed the PRO/100+ adapter. To start PROSet,
double-click on the PROSet icon in the Windows control panel. For
additional information, click Help in the PROSet window.

The defaults specified for the adapter work correctly for most
configurations.  When making changes to any adapter settings,
be sure to use PROSet rather than the Advanced tab under Properties
in the Network control panel.  


Manually Adding an Adapter in Windows 95 (For version 950B Only)
================================================================

If the New Hardware Found dialog box does not appear at startup and
you cannot connect to the network, check the Device Manager list to
see if the new adapter is present. If it is not, follow these steps:

1.  From the Control Panel, double-click the System icon.
2.  Click the Device Manager tab.
3.  Double-click Other Devices (question mark icon) in the list area.
4.  Double-click a PCI Ethernet Controller.
5.  Click the Driver tab, then click Update Driver.
6.  Insert the Configuration and Drivers disk or CD in the appropriate
    drive, and at the Update Device Driver Wizard, select "No" and 
    click Next.
7   Click Have Disk, insert the Configuration and Drivers disk
    in the appropriate drive, and click OK.
8.  At the Select Device dialog box, click OK again.
9.  Follow any prompts for Windows 95 installation disks and restart
    when prompted.
      
      Note: The Windows 95 system files are typically available on the
            Windows 95 CD in the win95 directory (D:\win95).

Hints and Tips
--------------

   Using NDIS 2 driver and Full Duplex:
   
   Installing the NDIS 2 driver through Windows 95 does not properly set
   the driver to Full Duplex.  In order for you to use Full Duplex with
   E100B.DOS, you must edit the PROTOCOL.INI file in the Windows 95
   directory to include:
   
   [E100B_NIF]
   Drivername = E100B$
   FORCEDUPLEX = 2

 - CHANGING ADAPTER SETTINGS WITH PROSET
   =====================================

There are two ways to run PROSet, which allows changing the adapter
settings.
   
   - From the Control Panel double-click on the PROSet icon.
   
   - From the Control Panel, double-click on the Network icon, select
     the Adapters tab, and double-click on the "Intel(R) PRO/100+
     PCI Adapter".


From the main PROSet menu click the Advanced tab to view and modify
adapter settings. The defaults work correctly for most configurations.


Speed
-----

Recommended setting:  Auto Detect (default)

This parameter lets the PRO/100+ adapter know what speed to use on the 
Ethernet wire.  The choices are 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, and Auto Detect.
In Auto Detect mode, the adapter detects if its environment can support
100 Mbps speed. It then sets the speed to 100 if it can, or 10 if it 
can't.
      
      Note: If you want to choose a Duplex Mode other than Auto Detect,
            you must set the speed to either 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps.


Duplex
------

Recommended setting: Auto Detect
      
      Auto Detect: The adapter negotiates with the hub or switch how
            to send/ receive packets, either full or half duplex.
      
      Full-Duplex: The adapter sends and receives packets at the same
            time. This improves the performance of your adapter. Set
            duplex mode to full duplex only if you have a full duplex
            switch.
      
      Half-Duplex: The adapter performs one operation at a time. It
            either sends or receives.

      Note: To change the Duplex mode, you must set the Speed to
            either 10 Mbps or 100 Mbps.

The PRO/100+ adapter has the ability to send and receive packets at
the same time (full-duplexing) at both 10 and 100 Mbps. In order to
reap the benefits of full duplexing, you MUST have a full duplex
hub or switch.

The PRO/100+ adapter has the added ability to "talk" to the hub or
switch and determine at which mode to communicate (either full or half
duplex). This is called auto-negotiation. You must have an auto-
negotiating hub or switch to get full duplex support with the Duplex
Mode set to Auto. If you don't have an auto-negotiating hub or switch
and want to run at full duplex, set Duplex Mode to Full and then set
the SPEED parameter to either 100 Mbps or 10 Mbps.

The PRO/100B T4 adapter can not operate in full duplex mode at 100 Mbps. 
The PRO/10+ PCI adapter can only operate in full duplex mode at 10 Mbps
and only on the TPE connector. The PRO/10+ PCI adapter does not support 
autonegotiation; it will run at half duplex unless forced.


Other Settings
==============

For information on other settings in the PROSet Advanced tab, use 
PROSet's context-sensitive online help.

   and click OK.

8  Specify the correct speed for your network. If you are using the TX
   based adapter, specify the correct duplex mode. If you are unsure of
   the correct settings, contact your Network Administrator.
   
   Note: If you set the PRO/100+ TX adapter to FULL duplex and you are
         running at 100 Mbps, you must change your speed setting to 100.
   
   Note: These options will not come up if you already have the NetWare
         ODI driver installed.  These settings are set in the NET.CFG
         file.

9  The driver and default protocols will appear in the Network Drivers
   window. If you need to add or remove a protocol, do so here.

10 In the Network Drivers window, click Close.

11 In the Network Setup window, click OK.

12 In the Microsoft Windows Network Names window, enter a unique user
   name, the name of your new or existing workgroup, and a unique

   currently installed with the versions you are installing now.

14 Insert the WFW disks WFW asks for. If prompted for the NetWare files,
   insert the Novell disk containing the drivers from the Novell file
   WINDR3.EXE. If prompted for the path of E100B.386, insert the 
   Configuration and Drivers disk into a drive and for the path, type:
      A:\WFW or D:\WFW if using the CD-ROM.
   If prompted for the path of E100B.DOS, specify:
      A:\DOS or D:\DOS if using the CD-ROM.

15 When finished updating the files, WFW reports that it modified
   several files. Click on OK. WFW changes your last drive to P:.  If
   you want to change this setting, do so in your CONFIG.SYS file.  WFW
   also modifies your NET.CFG file (for NetWare users).  Check this file
   to make sure your frame types load in the correct order for your
   network.

16 When WFW prompts you to restart your computer for the changes to take
   effect, click on Restart Computer.

Hints and Tips
--------------
General

1. If you are installing multiple PRO/100 adapters in WFW follow the
   instructions above for installing each adapter. Then, enter the
   adapter's 12-digit hexadecimal Ethernet address in the [IN$E100B]
   and [IN$E100B1] sections of the PROTOCOL.INI file. (The Ethernet
   address is printed on a sticker placed on the adapter. For dual-
   port adapters, increment the Ethernet address by 1 for the Ethernet
   address of the second port.)

Novell NetWare

1. Before you begin to install driver support for WFW and Novell NetWare
   on the same workstation, you'll need these Novell NetWare files:
   NETWARE.DRV, NETWARE.HLP, NWPOPUP.EXE, VIPX.386, and VNETWARE.386.
   To obtain these files, do one of the following:
   
   a  Download the self-extracting file WINDR3.EXE from Novell NetWare
      forum on CompuServe or Novell's FTP server on the internet
      (ftp.novell.com) or WWW
      (ftp://ftp.novell.com/pub/updates/nwos/dsclnt12).
   
   b  Contact Novell to have the files sent to you.
   
   c  Contact a Novell NetWare dealer in your area.

2  Set up the workstation to connect to NetWare using the DOS ODI client
   driver.

3  Load the ODI driver and login to your NetWare server.

4  Start WFW and set up the driver for the PRO/100+ adapter
   by following the instructions shown above. When the driver is chosen,
   WFW detects the ODI driver is already loaded and automatically
   installs the appropriate support.  Next to the adapter name in the
   Network Drivers window, you'll see [ODI/NDIS3] which indicates it
   recognized the ODI driver.


   Sample PROTOCOL.INI:

   Windows for Workgroups(WFW) creates the PROTOCOL.INI for you. This is
   provided for reference. This is a sample with Microsoft NetBEUI and
